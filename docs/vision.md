# Vision

The vision of this project to provide a mutation testing framework, that:

* has little source code overhead
* is easy to add to existing projects
* is fast by only compiling the test suite once
* calculates meaningful test coverage
* only produces mutations that are representable in rust source code
* provides useful feedback about the strength of test suite

WIP: further discussion
